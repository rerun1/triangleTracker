# Triangle Tracker
#### Jquery branching to find out what type of triangle a user enters
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 6th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
A web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:

Equilateral: All sides are equal.
Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
Scalene: No sides are equal.
NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
Once your application is functioning correctly, try to refactor your code as much as possible. Before moving on to the next challenge, have a teacher review your code.
